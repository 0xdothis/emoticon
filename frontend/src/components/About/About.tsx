      <p>Emoticon was born from a simple idea:  what if we could capture human emotion in the blockchain?
We are a team of artists, developers, and dreamers united by one mission to bring emotion into the digital world.</p>
<p>In a time when technology often feels cold and distant, we wanted to create something warm, relatable, and deeply human.</p>
      <p>Each Emoticon NFT is more than just a token, It’s a symbol of feeling. Every color, line, and curve was designed to tell a story and connect us all through shared emotion.</p>
